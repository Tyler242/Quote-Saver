# Overview

I wrote this program with the intent to learn and demonstrate the Kotlin language and become more familiar with SQL and MySql.

Quote Saver is an application that you can use to store quotes or sayings that are meaningful to you, or you would like to remember. It has a feature that allows you to search for quotes by words or source. Additional features allow you to edit and delete individual quotes. A keyword feature allows you to organize your quotes

# Development Environment

I used Intellij IDEA Community Edition with the Kotlin language and MySql to manage the database. I took an object-oriented approach to the program to gain more experience using classes and objects.

I also used a Java database connection driver. This paired with the Java SQL library is how I connected to the database.
